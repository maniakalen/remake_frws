<br />
<br />

The template wizard will assist you in creating the necessary {accounts} functions to pull member accounts from the database and will also generate the {foreach} function to
display each of the accounts on your page.  This document will cover how to use the template wizard.

<b class="heading">Accessing the Template Wizard</b>

<br />
<br />

To access the template wizard use the Ranking Pages &gt; Edit Templates function.  This will load the page where you edit your ranking page templates.  In the header bar of this page that
reads Ranking Page Templates you can click on the <img src="../images/wizard.png" border="0"> icon to access the template wizard.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Basic Overview</b>

<br />
<br />

The template wizard is something that will help you to generate the {accounts} and {foreach} commands that you will need to use to pull accounts from the database and
display them on your page(s).  

<br />
<br />

For HTML templates, the wizard will not generate a complete template for you with all of the HTML code that you need for a full page.  It is designed to give you
the code you need for a specific section of accounts.  For example, if you want to quickly generate the template code necessary to display accounts ranked 1-20 on the
page, you can use the template wizard.  The code that the wizard creates will need to be inserted into your ranking page template code at the location where you want the
accounts to appear.

<br />
<br />

For RSS feed templates, the wizard will generate the complete template for you.  You will simply need to copy the entire generated template code and save it for the 
RSS feed template.  Make sure your RSS feed templates have a .xml, .rdf, or .rss file extension!

<br />
<br />

<div class="note">
Remember, you are not limited to a single section of accounts per page; you can have as many sections as you want.  Therefore, you can use the wizard multiple times to
create all of the template code you will need for your page to pull accounts for each of the sections of accounts that you want to display on the page.
