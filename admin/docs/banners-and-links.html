<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

Before you begin accepting account submissions you will want to configure some of the software templates so that your member accounts will
be provided with the link code they should use on their sites.  You can also update the link code in the future when you add new banners and/or
links for your members to use.  This document will give an overview of what templates you will want to edit to provide your members with the
banners and/or links they will use.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">General Concepts</b>

<br />
<br />

The default template set provided with the software does not include any default links or banners for your members to use.  This has been left
up to you, so you can provide your member accounts with the exact links you want them to use on their sites.

<br />
<br />

The best way to provide your members with the links they should use is to give them the exact HTML code they should place in their page.  There
are a couple of different methods that you can use to display HTML code for your users to copy:

<ul>
<b>The &lt;xmp&gt; HTML tag</b><br />
HTML code has a special &lt;xmp&gt; tag that will force the user's browser display the actual HTML code instead of rendering it.  For example,
if you used this code in your page:

<pre class="code">&lt;xmp&gt;&lt;a href="{$tracking_url|htmlspecialchars}"&gt;Top 100 Joke Sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/xmp&gt;</pre>

It would display in the user's browser like this:

<xmp><a href="{$tracking_url|htmlspecialchars}">Top 100 Joke Sites</a></xmp>

The user would be able to select this HTML code, copy it, and paste it into their page.

<br /><br />

<b>The &lt;textarea&gt; HTML tag</b><br />
The &lt;textarea&gt; tag is similar to the &lt;xmp&gt; tag, however it will display the HTML code in a text input box instead of directly in the
page.  When using a textarea tag it is also necessary to convert the &lt; and &gt; characters to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; respectively.  For example,
if you used this code in your page:

<pre class="code">&lt;textarea rows="3" cols="80"&gt;
&amp;lt;a href="{$tracking_url|htmlspecialchars}"&amp;gt;Top 100 Joke Sites&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/textarea&gt;</pre>

It would display in the user's browser like this:<br /><br />

<textarea rows="3" cols="80">
&lt;a href="{$tracking_url|htmlspecialchars}"&gt;Top 100 Joke Sites&lt;/a&gt;
</textarea>
</ul>

If you would like to provide your members with banners to use on their sites, you will use the standard HTML &lt;img&gt; tag to show the actual
banner in the ToplistX pages.  For example, if you had a banner for your site located at http://www.yoursite.com/banners/468x60.gif you would
use this &lt;img&gt; tag in your ToplistX template(s) to show the banner to the user:

<xmp class="code"><img src="http://www.yoursite.com/banners/468x60.gif"></xmp>

<br />

<b class="heading">Editing the ToplistX Templates</b>

<br />
<br />

There are a few different templates that you can use to provide your members with the HTML code they should use for the links on their site, however
there are 2 templates that you will definitely want to edit to provide your link code.  Those two templates are:

<ul>
<b>accounts-added.tpl</b><br />
This template is displayed to the member after their account has been successfully added.  This is an ideal place to provide members with the banners
and/or links they should use on their site since it is the first page they will see after they signup.  In the default accounts-added.tpl template there
is a section of the template that has been commented out using the {* *} template syntax.  You can uncomment that section and place the banners and/or links
that you want your members to use there.

<br />
<br />

<b>accounts-banners-links.tpl</b><br />
This template is displayed in the account maintenance interface when the user selects to get banners and links.  This is the second best place to setup
the banners and/or links that you want your members to use.  The default template included with the software does not display anything on this page, so you
will need to add your links and/or banners to this page so your members will have something to choose from.
</ul>

To provide your members with the correct URL that they should use for their links, you should use the {$tracking_url|htmlspecialchars} template variable.  You
should use this template variable rather than hard-coding the URL so that the software can automatically generate the correct URL for them to use based on the
software settings.
