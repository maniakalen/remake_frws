<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

The main function of ToplistX is to maintain a database of member accounts and track their stats, so it is obviously important to understand how the software handles them.  This document will give
you an overview of how to add, maintain, and remove accounts.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Searching Accounts<a name="search"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

To search the current accounts in your database so you can modify or delete them, access the Accounts &gt; Search Accounts function from the control panel menu.  This will display a 
page where you will be able select a number of different search options so you can quickly locate the account(s) you want to work with.  Most of the database fields that you can search
use the software's <a href="standard-searches.html">Standard Search</a> function, however the <b>Title, Description &amp; Keywords</b> field uses the <a href="boolean-searches.html">Boolean Search</a> feature.  The
When you perform a search, the accounts that match your search terms will be displayed like the following example:

<br />
<br />

<img src="accounts-search.png" border="1">

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li> Use this checkbox to select this account when you want to run a function on multiple accounts at once
<li> This section displays the account's current settings.
<li> This is the value that the current search results were sorted by
<li> These are the functions that you can run on this specific account
</ol>


The functions that you can run on each individual account (marked D in the image above) are described below.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Account Status<a name="status"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

When accounts are submitted they are assigned a status which determines how they will be handled by the software and when they will be displayed on your ranking pages.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right" nowrap="nowrap">

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Reviewing Pending Accounts<a name="review"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

Pending accounts can be reviewed directly from the Search Accounts interface.  Using the ToDO &gt; Review New Accounts function you can quickly access the Search Accounts
interface to see only the pending accounts.  Once the page has loaded, you will see all of your pending accounts, and you can begin processing them.

<br />
<br />

For each pending account, there will be two additional icons and a drop down selection field in their Functions column.  You can click on the <img src="../images/check.png" border="0" alt="">
icon to approve the account, or the <img src="../images/x.png" border="0" alt=""> icon to reject the account.  It is also possible to approve or reject multiple accounts at once.  To do this,
put a check in the checkbox for each account that you want to approve, then scroll to the bottom of the page and press the Approve button.  The same can be done for rejecting several accounts
at once.

<br />
<br />

When an account is approved, it's status will be set to Active and it will be eligible for display on your ranking pages.  The contents of the email-account-added.tpl template will be sent to
the account owner if the e-mail option is enabled in the General Settings interface.

<br />
<br />

When an account is rejected, it will be immediately deleted from the database.  Using the drop down selection field in the Functions column, you can select the rejection e-mail message that should
be sent to the account.  If you select None, no e-mail message will be sent.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Reviewing Edited Accounts<a name="review-edit"></a></b>

<br />
<br />

If you have selected the option to review account edits, you will be able to review them directly from the Search Accounts interface.  Using the ToDo &gt; Review Edited Accounts function you 
can quickly access the Search Accounts interface to see only the accounts that have been edited.  Once the page has loaded, you will see all of the edited accounts, and you can begin processing them.

<br />
<br />

For each pending account, there will be a yellow colored section of data following the normal account data.  This section will show the information that the site owner has changed, so you can quickly
compare it with the existing information and decide if you want to accept the changes.  You can click on the <img src="../images/check.png" border="0" alt="">
icon to approve the new information, or the <img src="../images/x.png" border="0" alt=""> icon to reject the new information and leave the account as it currently is listed.
