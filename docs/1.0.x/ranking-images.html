<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

The image.php script can be used to display banners on your member sites that show their current rank.  You can set it
up to only display the rank on the banners for the top few sites, or you can have it show the rank for all sites in
your database.  As an example, say you have a site that is ranked #3 on your list.  You can then provide special HTML
to this member so that a banner or button will appear on their site with a number 3 on it.  Of course, you will be able
to include other things on the banner/button like information about your site.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Preparing for Use</b>

<br />
<br />

To prepare for using image.php, you need to decide how many images you want to display the site's rank on.  Keep in mind that
you will have to create a separate banner for each of the banners with a ranking number on it, so you probably don't want to
go too high on this.  For this example, let's say that the top 5 ranked sites will have images on their site displaying their
rank - all other sites will display the same image, but without their current rank.

<br />
<br />

Once you have decided on a number, you need to enter it in the <b>Images To Show</b> field of the General Settings interface.  For this example
you would enter 5 in this field.

<br />
<br />

Now you need to create the banners/buttons that will be displayed on your member sites.  The software allows you to configure the file extension
you are using for your images, so you can use any image format that you like.  For this example, let's assume that you are using PNG images for
your ranking images which will have a .png file extension.  Enter png in the <b>File Extension</b> setting in the General Settings interface.  
For the banner/button that will be displayed on sites where the rank is not on the image, name this file default.png.
For the other images with the rank on them, name them 1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc where the number in the filename matches the number on the image.

<br />
<br />

Once all of your images have been created, upload them to your server to the directory that corresponds with the Ranking Images URL you entered in
the General Settings interface.  This is the final thing you need to do to prepare for usage.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Providing Link Syntax To Your Members</b>

<br />
<br />

Providing the link syntax for your members to use is pretty straightforward.  For example, on the accounts-banners-links.tpl template you can
use this code to provide your members with the HTML they will need to place on their site to get the ranking image to appear:

<xmp><a href="{$tracking_url|htmlspecialchars}">
<img src="{$config.install_url}/image.php?id={$account.username|htmlspecialchars}" border="0"></a></xmp>

This example is a simple img tag wrapped in a link to your site using the tracking URL.
