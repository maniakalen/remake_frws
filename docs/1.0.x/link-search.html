The link search function in LinkX allows you to quickly locate links so they can be approved, edited, deleted, etc.  This document provides an overview of the link search
interface.

<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="right">

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>

If you would like to view links that have been edited and are awaiting approval of the changes they have made, check the Edited checkbox.  You can also choose
how the links are sorted by selecting the sorting field from the drop down list.  The available sorting fields correspond with the search fields which are 
described above.  Once you have the search values filled in how you want them, press the search button to display the links that meet your criteria.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Link Functions</b>

<br />
<br />

In the links section you will be able to run a number of different functions on the links that are displayed.  By default the following link information will
be displayed:

<ul>
<li> The site title, which is linked to the site URL
<li> The site description
<li> The link weight value
<li> The number of clicks the link has received
<li> The number of comments for the link
<li> The number of ratings the link has received
<li> The link's average rating
</ul>

To display additional information about the link, click on the <img src="../images/go-down.png" width="11" height="10" border="0" alt=""> icon.  This will send a 
request to your server for the information, so it may take a couple of seconds to load.  Once it has been loaded, the information will slide into view.  All pending
links will have this additional information automatically displayed so you can see it quickly when you are processing new submissions.

<br />
<br />

Clicking on the icons in the Functions column of the
table will allow you to run that function on a single link.  You can also check the boxes next to multiple links to perform the functions listed at the bottom
of the page.  The single link function icons are each described below.
