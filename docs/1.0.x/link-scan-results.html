<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

After you have run the link scanner you will be able to display the results to see what actions were taken for the links that were found to be no longer working or breaking
your rules.  This document will describe how to view the link scanner results and the functions you can use from that interface.


<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Viewing Link Scanner Results</b>

<br />
<br />

To view the link scanner results use the Directory &gt; Links &gt; Scan Links function from the control panel menu.  This will load a page which will show the current
link scanner configurations that are defined.  You can click on the <img src="../images/report.png" width="12" height="12" border="0" alt=""> icon for any of those
configurations to see the results from the last scan that was run.

<br />
<br />

When you click on one of those icons you will come to a page where you will see the link scanner results and be able to search them.  To start your search, enter the
term you would like to search for in the text input box and select the field that you would like to search in. Each of the search fields is described below.

<ul>
<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" class="fields">

You can also choose how the links are sorted by selecting the sorting field from the drop down list.  The available sorting fields correspond with the search fields which are
