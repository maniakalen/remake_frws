<b class="heading">Introduction</b>

<br />
<br />

The General Settings interface allows you to configure the software options as you like.  There are a number of settings that you can adjust, and each of them
is described in this section of the manual.

<br />
<br />

<b class="heading">Basic Settings</b>

<ul>
<b>Document Root</b> - This is the full directory path to the root of your website where ToplistX is installed.  For example, when you access http://www.yoursite.com/index.html
the index.html file is located in your Document Root folder.  ToplistX will try to automatically set this value for you, so in most cases you do not need
to change this setting.<br /><br />

<b>ToplistX URL</b> - This is the the base URL where ToplistX is installed on your server<br /><br />

<b>Banner URL</b> - This is the URL that points to the directory on your server where you want member banners stored if you choose the option to download and
serve them from your server.  This should point to an empty directory with 777 permissions that is located inside the Document Root.<br /><br />

<b>Cookie Domain</b> - The domain name to use when setting cookies.  This must contain the domain name of the website where ToplistX is installed.<br /><br />

<b>Page Permissions</b> - The file permissions to set on the generated ranking pages.
<br /><br />

<b>E-mail Address</b> - This is the e-mail address will appear in the From field of all e-mails sent by ToplistX<br /><br />
<b>E-mail Name</b> - This is the name that will appear in the From field of all e-mails sent by ToplistX<br /><br />
<b>E-mail Sender</b> - Choose the method that ToplistX will use for sending emails.  In most cases you should leave this set to the default PHP mail() Function
option.

<br />
<br />

<ul>
<b>PHP mail() Function</b> - ToplistX will use PHP's built in mail() function for sending e-mail messages.<br />
<b>Sendmail</b> - ToplistX will use sendmail on your server to send e-mail messages.  This will require that PHP is not running
in safe mode and the popen() function is not disabled.  You will need to enter the full path to sendmail in the text input box
after the drop down selection field.<br />
<b>SMTP Server</b> - ToplistX will use a SMTP server to send e-mail messages.  This will require that the SMTP server has authorized your
server to send e-mail messages through it.  You will need to enter the hostname of the SMTP server in the input box after the drop
down selection field.
</ul>

<br />
<br />

<b>Date Format</b> - The string that specifies the <a href="date-time-formats.html">format</a> to use for date values<br /><br />
<b>Time Format</b> - The string that specifies the <a href="date-time-formats.html">format</a> to use for time values<br /><br />
<b>Your Timezone</b> - Select the timezone you are located in so that dates and times can be calculated properly<br /><br />
<b>Decimal Point</b> - The value to use for the decimal point in numbers<br /><br />
<b>Thousands Separator</b> - The value to use for the thousands separator in numbers<br /><br />

<b>Using cron to automate page building, hourly stats, and daily stats</b> - Check this box only if you have setup cron to handle the rebuilding of your pages and
calculation of the hourly and daily stats.<br /><br />

<b>Rebuild Interval</b> - The <b>minimum</b> amount of time, in seconds, between page rebuilds.  This only has an affect if you are not using cron for rebuilds.

</ul>

<b class="heading">Ranking Images Settings</b>

The ranking images feature of the software allows you to display an image on your member sites that shows the current position of that site in the ranks.  For
example, if a member site is currently ranked #2 you can have an image display on their site that says they are ranked #2 in your list.  More information can
be found in the <a href="ranking-images.html">Ranking Images</a> section of the software manual.

<ul>
<b>Ranking Images URL</b> - The URL where you will place the ranking images to display on your member sites<br /><br />
<b>Images To Show</b> - The number of ranking images you will create with numbers on them<br /><br />
<b>File Extension</b> - The file extension of the ranking images you have created.
</ul>

<b class="heading">Click Tracking &amp; Rating Settings</b>

<ul>
<b>Tracking Mode</b> - Choose the method that you want the software to use for statistics tracking.  More information on the software stat tracking system
can be found in the <a href="tracking-overview.html">Statistical Tracking Overview</a> section of the manual.

<br />
<br />

<ul>
<b>Accounts send surfers directly to your site</b> - With this method, account holders will be able to send surfers to any URL on your site that you specify,
as long as you are able to include the in.php click tracking script as part of that page (using SSI, PHP, or an &lt;img&gt; tag).  This is generally a better choice
for search engine optimization.

<br /><br />

<b>Unique link for each account</b> - With this method, each member account will be given a unique link that they will need to place on their sites
to track the surfers that they send to your site.  The link will point to the ToplistX in.php script and contain their account username in the URL
for tracking purposes.
</ul>

<br />

<b>Secret Key</b> - A unique value used with the <i>Accounts send surfers directly to your site</i> tracking mode.  This can be any string of characters, but may only
contain English letters, numbers, and the underscore character.    You will need to use this value in your embedded tracking code, as described in the
<a href="tracking-overview.html">Statistical Tracking Overview</a> section of the manual. DO NOT SHARE THIS VALUE WITH ANYONE!<br /><br />

<b>Tracking URL</b> - The URL that member accounts will use to track their statistics.  If you are using <i>Unique link for each account</i>, this must point to the
ToplistX in.php script.  If you are using the <i>Accounts send surfers directly to your site</i>, this must point to the page on your site that has the in.php script
embedded.<br /><br />

<b>Default Forward URL</b> - If you are using <i>Unique link for each account</i>, this is the URL that surfers will be sent to after their click is recorded by the in.php script.<br /><br />

<b>Alternate Out URL</b> - If you are using the skimming feature of the out.php script, this is the URL that surfers will be sent to when none of your accounts are owed clicks but the
surfer should be sent to one of your accounts based on the skim percentage.<br /><br />

<b>Redirect Status Code</b> - The HTTP status code that the software should use when redirecting surfers to your member sites.  In most cases you will want to use 301 for this value, although
you could select any of the 30x HTTP status codes.<br /><br />

<b>Maximum Site Rating</b> - The maximum value a surfer can select for a site rating.<br /><br />

<b>Comment Length</b> - The minimum and maximum number of characters allowed in a surfer comment.<br /><br />

<b>Comment Interval</b> - The amount of time, in seconds, that a user must wait before submitting another comment for the same account.<br /><br />

<b>Review new surfer comments before displaying them on your site</b> - Check this box if you want to review surfer comments before they appear on your site
